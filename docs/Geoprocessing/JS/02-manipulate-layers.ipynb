    "## Adding Feature Layer into WebMap\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this section, we will discuss how to add `feature layers` to a `web map` using the `ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript`.\n",
    "- A `feature layer` is a type of layer that contains a set of features (`points`, `lines`, or `polygons`) and their `attributes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "- The FeatureLayer class is used to create a layer that can be added to a map. It connects to a feature service and retrieves the features and their attributes. Hereâ€™s how you can add a feature layer to your map:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import the `FeatureLayer Class`**: Ensure you import the `FeatureLayer class` from the `ArcGIS API`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "  require([\n",
    "      \"esri/Map\",\n",
    "      \"esri/views/MapView\",\n",
    "      \"esri/layers/FeatureLayer\"\n",
    "  ], function (Map, MapView, FeatureLayer) {\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a FeatureLayer Instance**: Create a new instance of `FeatureLayer` by providing the `URL` to the feature service and any additional properties such as the renderer and labeling info.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `url`: The URL to the feature service.\n",
    "- `renderer`: Defines how the features in the layer should be rendered.\n",
    "- `labelingInfo`: Provides labeling information for the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```js\n",
    "  const trailheads = new FeatureLayer({\n",

    "    labelingInfo: [trailheadsLabels],\n",
    "  });\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add the `FeatureLayer` to the `Map`**: Add the created FeatureLayer instance to the map using the add method.\n",

    "## Customized Rendering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will discuss how to customize the rendering of `feature layers`. Customizing rendering allows you to control how the features in your layer are displayed, including their `symbols`, `colors`, `sizes`, and `labels`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Renderers\n",
    "\n",
    "A renderer defines how features are visualized on the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `renderer` property of a `FeatureLayer` specifies the visual style for the features in the layer.\n",
    "- There are several types of renderers, but in this example, we will focus on the `SimpleRenderer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`SimpleRenderer`**: The `SimpleRenderer` class applies the same symbol to all features in the layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `type`: Specifies the type of renderer. In this case, it is \"simple\".\n",
    "   - `symbol`: Defines the symbol used for rendering. Here, we are using a picture-marker symbol with a URL to an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   const trailheadsRenderer = {\n",
    "     type: \"simple\",\n",

    "   };\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `VisualVariables`: These allow you to vary the symbols used to render features based on their attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In the `trails` layer, the line thickness varies based on the `ELEV_GAIN` attribute.\n",
    "   - `visualVariables`: An array of objects that define how to vary the symbol properties (such as size, color) based on attribute values.\n",
    "   - `field`: The attribute field used to drive the visual variable.\n",
    "   - `minDataValue` and maxDataValue: Define the range of data values.\n",
    "   - `minSize` and `maxSize`: Define the minimum and maximum sizes for the symbol.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - To add click functionality to the map, you use the `view.on(\"click\", function (event) {...})` method.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - The hit test results are filtered to find `graphics` that belong to the specific layers you are interested in (`trailheads`, `trails`, `parks`).\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Checking for Valid Graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "   - After filtering, it checks if a valid `graphic` was found.\n",
    "   - If a graphic is found, the map view zooms into the feature and opens a `pop-up` at the location where the user clicked.\n",
