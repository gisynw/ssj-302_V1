    "- A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.\n",

    "  3. The `inner mysite/` directory is the actual Python package for your project.\n",
    "     - Its name is the Python package name you’ll need to use to **import** anything inside it (e.g. `mysite.urls`).\n",
    "  4. `mysite/__init__.py`: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be **considered a Python package**\n",
    "  5. `mysite/settings.py`: Settings/configuration for this Django project.\n",
    "     - Django settings will tell you all about how settings work.\n",
    "  6. `mysite/urls.py`: The URL declarations for this Django project; a `table of contents` of your Django-powered site.\n",
