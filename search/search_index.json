When the distance between\n         features is less than the cluster tolerance, the features with the\n         lower rank will snap to the feature with the higher rank. The highest\n         rank is one. All of the input features must be polygons.\n     join_attributes {String}:\n         Specifies which attributes from the input features will be transferred\n         to the output feature class.ALL-All the attributes from the input\n         features will be transferred to\n         the output feature class.

Gaps are areas in the\n         output feature class that are completely\n         enclosed by other polygons (created from the intersection of features\n         or from existing holes in the input polygons). These areas are not\n         invalid, but you can identify them for analysis. To identify the gaps\n         in the output, set this parameter to NO_GAPS, and a feature will be\n         created in these areas.
